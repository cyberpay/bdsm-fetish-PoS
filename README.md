<h3 style="text-align: center;">BDSM and Fetish merge into 1 single low coin count coin<br />
BDSM-FETISH .... WHIPPED</h3>

<p>I have been thinking about BDSM and Fetish. The volume is on the low side and it is expensive and time consuming mining transaction fees to ensure the network does not stop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Therefore, a new coin will be made with 100% distribution to current owners of either coin.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>YOU CAN SWAP THEM BY SENDING TO MY 2ND ACCOUNT AT CRYPTOPIA. YOU GET A RECORD THEN AT AN OFFICIAL &nbsp;CHANNEL.</strong></p>

<p>The easier and cheapest option is this:&nbsp;<br />
1. to go 100% PoS&nbsp;<br />
2. to merge the two coins into one&nbsp;<br />
3. to reduce the coin count as a proportion&nbsp;<br />
4. to make a new BDSM-FETISH (quite literally, the other two die and have no effect on the new coin and how it operates)&nbsp;<br />
5. to collect coins from people and repay them with BDSM-FETISH (as noted above) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>A simple method is to distribute the new at the rate of half a coin per mined block, which itself is an avarage of all mined blocks (before TX fees only).</p>

<p>Fetish went to transaction fees only at 855,000 blocks with about 1.22 million coins. So on average that would make a mined block worth 2.8 Fetish. BDSM went to transactions only at 830,00 blocks with approximately 11.8m BDSM, which is an average of 28 and a bit BDSM per block. &nbsp;</p>

<p>TRANSACTION FEE BLOCKS ARE NOT INCLUDED (or worth including).</p>

<p>The block count could be merged to produce an average. That is, &nbsp;830,000 + 855,000 -50% = 842,000 full shares.&nbsp;</p>

<p>BDSM (14 coins) &nbsp;= 0.5 BDSM-FETISH<br />
BDSM (28 coins) = 1 BDSM-FETISH &nbsp;<br />
Fetish (1.4 coins) = 0.5 BDSM-Fetish &nbsp;<br />
Fetish (2.8 coins) = 1 BDSM-Fetish &nbsp;</p>

<p>The total possible coin count is <strong>842,000</strong>, which keeps it nicely under the million mark. &nbsp;Interest would be quite low compared to the current PoS coins at about 2 % yearly, or 16,840 coins (more because of compounding interest). &nbsp;That would equate to 46.13+ coins minted daily.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Staking would average at 8 minutes.</p>

<p>Unclaimed shares could be burned. A small proportion could be given away to Cryptopia faucet/reward scheme, perhaps, as they will be caused extra work. &nbsp;A proportion could be held for stragglers for a short period and burned if they do no show up.</p>

<p>If there is signficant amount left, I might just redistribute it to former claimants pro-rata.</p>

<p>This will secure the network and hopefully bring a new lease of life since the coins have had such a run of bad luck with hacked exchanges and so on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Recommend to leave the unlocked wallet open as often as practical as you have more chance of staking. Plus, the more coins you have, the larger the stake (2% of 10,000 is more than 2% of 100). The easiest way to leave a wallet open without hassle is on a server. You can even run it as a daemon if you use Linux.</p>
